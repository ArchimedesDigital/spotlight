    <h2>Why Spotlight?</h2>
    <p>
    Set up Spotlight at your institution or organization and
    you can offer a <span class="strong">self-service approach</span>
    for creating exhibit websites that
    <span class="strong">highlight your digital collections</span>.

    Your curators can build highly-customized exhibits, tailored to their
    collections, with easy-to-use site configuration and page-building options.

    And because Spotlight is based on
    <a title="Blacklight" href="http://projectblacklight.org/">Blacklight</a>,
    exhibits offer end-users robust
    searching, browsing, and object display capabilities.
